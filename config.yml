  # Configuration for the LED display output.
  Display:
    # To counteract electrical noise that might corrupt the LED state, the system
    # can periodically force a full refresh of all LED strips. This ensures the
    # display remains stable. Set to 0 to disable.
    ForceUpdateDelay: 500ms

    # Provides a simple mechanism for color correction. The final color values sent
    # to the LEDs are multiplied by these factors. This is useful for balancing the

    # to achieve a warmer white).
